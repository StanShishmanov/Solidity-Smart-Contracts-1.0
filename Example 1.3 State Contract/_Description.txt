Write a contract, that:
  - Has 3 kinds of states: locked, unlocked and restricted
  - The owner can change the state
  - Locked means that nobody can call public contract functions (even fallback)
  - Unlocked means that everyone can call contract functions
  - Restricted means that only the owner can call contract functions
  - Have a structure that contains a counter, a timestamp and an address
  - Have a function that increments the counter by one, sets the current timestamp and sets the address to
that of the caller
