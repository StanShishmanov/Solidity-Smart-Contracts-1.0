Write a contract, that:
 - Can accept ETH
 - Has N number of owners (a list of owners given in constructor)
 - A proposal can be made to transfer funds to an account (make it a struct)
 - For the proposal to be accepted, each owner must agree in the order defined in the list
	o For the second owner to agree, the first one has to agree first.
	o The same logic for all owners
 - If all agree within 5 minutes of the proposal, the proposal is accepted and the funds are transferred
 - Include the necessary constraints
