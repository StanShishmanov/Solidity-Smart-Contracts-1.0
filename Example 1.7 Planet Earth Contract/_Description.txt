Planet Earth Contract
Create contract that:
 - Declares all continents (Europe, Asia, etc..). Use the best way to declare them – we know that there are
	fixed amount of continents and we know their names
 - Declares a data representing a single country (name, continent, population)
 - Keep track of each country’s capital, so people can check country’s capital by simply giving a name
 - Store only European countries
 - Have a function to add country (should accept only European countries). The function accepts all countrie’s 
	properties (name, continent, population)
 - Have function to add a capital to a single country (No duplicates – i.e. Sofia cannot be a capital of both
	Bulgaria and Romania)
 - Have a function that gives the capital by a given country name
 - Have a function to remove a capital
 - Have a function that returns the string representation of each continent (i.e. I receive “Asia”, “Europe”, etc.)
 - Have a function that returns all European countries
