Simple Token Contract
Create contract that represents a token with the following characteristics:
 - The token has name.
 - The token has symbol.
 - The token has decimals (e.g. decimals = 2, value 100 should be interpreted as 1.00)
 - Keep track of users balances
 - Has a total supply (the total number of tokens that exists)
	o The total supply should be given as a parameter to the constructor
	o The total supply should be assigned to the contract creator
	o Keep in mind the decimals
 - The contract should NOT accept ETH. Penalize everyone who is trying to send ethers to the contract.
 - Have a function that transfers a number of tokens to another address
 - Emit events when appropriate
