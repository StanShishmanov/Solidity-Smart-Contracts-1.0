Voting Contract
Create a contract, that:
 - Is Owned
 - Can be killed
 - Uses safe math operations
 - Has members (people that are member of the contract)
 - The owner is the first member
 - The owner can remove members
 - To add a new member, there needs to be a voting
	o If >50% of the members agree, the new member is added
 - For each member we hold:
	o His address
	o ETH donated to the contract
	o Timestamp of last donation
	o Value of last ETH donation
 - A member can be removed from the contract if he hasn’t donated to the contract in the last 1 hour
 - Use a library for all member related actions
 - Bonus if you don’t use any arrays or loops :)
