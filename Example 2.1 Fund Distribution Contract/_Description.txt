Fund distributing
 - Write a contract, that can receive funds from any address
 - The contract has n members (list of addresses by the owner)
 - n>=3
 - Each member has an importance (an integer, the higher value the more important is this member’s opinion)
 - Only the owner can make a proposal for certain funds to be sent to an address
 - Members vote on the proposal
 - The owner cannot be a member
 - Each member votes with his importance points
 - For it to be successful, half of the total importance of the members has to vote for it.
 - Use a Library for voting-related actions
 - Use a withdraw pattern to allow the proposed address to get the voted funds
 - Have a minimal constructor and separate init()
 - You can’t avoid loops, but you can make their use minimal :)
