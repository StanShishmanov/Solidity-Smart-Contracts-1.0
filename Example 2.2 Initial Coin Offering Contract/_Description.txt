Initial Crowd Offering
 - Make an ICO contract
 - Use whichever structure or methods you prefer
 - There is a presale stage where the token costs 1ETH each
 - Later, during the ICO stage the token becomes 2ETH
 - After presale + ICO, the token is no-longer sold and can be transferred
 - Avoid any anti-pattern, both in security and optimization
 - Have unit tests for every major action!
 - Protection against reentrancy
 - Use checks-effects-interactions pattern
